The Water Cycle

The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. This process is crucial for maintaining life on our planet.

Key Components:
1. Evaporation: Water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into water vapor due to heat from the sun.
2. Condensation: Water vapor cools and forms clouds.
3. Precipitation: Water falls from clouds as rain, snow, or hail.
4. Collection: Water collects in oceans, lakes, and rivers, starting the cycle again.

This natural process ensures that water is constantly recycled and available for all living organisms.
